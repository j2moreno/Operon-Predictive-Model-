# Operon-Predictive-Model

Hypothesis: the use of intergenic distances between adjacent genes in the same strand could be used to infer membership of the same operon in E. coli

Python Scipy Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) was used to model both positive, negative controls, and posterior probabilities. Matplotlib was used for plotting purposes. 

Model was tested for specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy in order to validate our model was able to infer membership of same operon.
